MOODS version 1.00
=======================

MOODS (Motif Occurrence Detection System) is a suite of algorithm for matching
position weight matrices against a DNA sequences. We have implemented state-of-
the-art on-line matching algorithms, achieving considerably faster scanning
speed than a simple brute-force search. Our algorithms are written in C++.
There are also extensions to the popular BioPerl toolkit and BioPython toolkit.

INSTALLATION
Algorithms can be compiled to static c++ library by typing "make" in the "src"
directory. (do always this first)

Installing extensions:
- For perl extension see perl/README.
- For python extension see python/README
