MOODS version 1.0.2
=======================

MOODS is a suite of algorithms for matching position weight matrices (PWM) against DNA sequences. It features advanced matrix matching algorithms implemented in C++ that can be used to scan hundreds of matrices against chromosome-sized sequences in few seconds.

MOODS can be used as standalone analysis tool or as a component in larger programs. It contains Python and Perl/BioPerl interfaces, and can thus be easily called from C++, Python and Perl programs.

MOODS is dual-licenced under GPL version 3 license and Biopython license. See COPYING.GPLv3 and COPYING.BIOPYTHON files for license details.
